# CSCI2103_COQ_INDEPENDENT_STUDY

    Under the guidance of Professor Carl McTague and Professor Robert Muller of the Boston College Computer Science Department, this respository contains a series of explorations into proof verification with Coq. The bulk of the repository is currently a medley of excersizes from Software Foundations Volume 1, which allowed me to hone the skills necesary to write efficient verification algorithms for functional programs. The Red Black and BST proof files contain implemnations of a red black tree and simple BST in Coq, respectively, as well as verifcations for insertion. Additionally, the red black file contains lookup and efficiency proofs, showing that the self-balancing mechanism preserves the integrity of lookup and the running time of both algorithms is O(log N). 

    This repository will be updated frequently over teh course of the next year, as I hope to translate these foudnational skills into a large scale proof algorithm with drop-down ability into OCaml as part of a larger senior thesis.
